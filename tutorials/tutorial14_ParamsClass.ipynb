    "This tutorial walks you through the process of using different parameters classes. Understanding how these classes work is fundamental in designing your own scenarios with the use of Flow. The classes featured in this tutorial are the `InitialConfig`, `SUMOCarFollowingParams`, `EnvParams` and the `SUMOParams`. Each of these classes are detailed in their corresponding section in this tutorial.\n",

    "`InitialConfig` specifies parameters that affect the positioning of vehicle in the network at the start of a simulation. These parameters can be used to limit the edges and number of lanes vehicles originally occupy, and provide a means of adding randomness to the starting positions of vehicles. In order to introduce a small initial disturbance to the system of vehicles in the network, we set the `perturbation` term in `InitialConfig` to 1m.\n",
