    "# Tutorial 14: Params Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the use of different parameters classes. Understanding how these classes work is fundamental in designing your own experiments in Flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classes featured in this tutorial are `InitialConfig`,`SumoCarFollowingParams`, `SumoParams` and `EnvParams`. Each of these classes is detailed in their corresponding sections in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the classical Sugiyama experiment involving a loop (ring road) with a single lane and a fixed number of vehicles on it, similar to what is done in tutorial 1. This one though focuses on the use of the parameters in the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial is divided into 4 sections and is organized as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `InitialConfig`\n",
    "2. `SumoCarFollowingParams`\n",
    "3. `SumoParams`\n",
    "4. `EnvParams`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. InitialConfig\n",
    "\n",
    "`InitialConfig` specifies parameters that affect the positioning of vehicles in the network at the start of a rollout. These parameters can be used for instance to limit the edges and number of lanes vehicles initially occupy, or to provide a means of adding randomness to the starting positions of vehicles. By default, the vehicles are uniformly distributed in the network, across all edges and lanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the vehicles\" means the vehicles that are initially present in the network when the simulation starts, i.e. not the vehicles added during the simulation via inflows but those added via `vehicles.add(num_vehicles=...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 List of possible parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the parameters which can be set up within `InitialConfig`, along with their default values and description:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `shuffle` (_bool, optional_): specifies whether the ordering of the vehicles should be shuffled. Default to False.\n",
    "- `spacing` (_str, optional_): specifies the initial positioning of the vehicles. Can be either one of: \n",
    "    - \"uniform\" (default value): the vehicles will be placed uniformly\n",
    "    - \"random\": the vehicles will be placed randomly\n",
    "    - \"custom\": you must specify a custom ordering\n",
    "- `min_gap` (_float, optional_): the minimum gap to be kept between two vehicles among all the vehicles, in meters. Defaults to 0 meters. \n",
    "- `x0` (_float, optional_): position of the first vehicle to be placed in the network. Can be used to shift the position of all the vehicles. The position is an edge position (c.f. the `specify_edge_starts` method in the scenario). Defaults to 0.\n",
    "- `perturbation` (_float, optional_): standard deviation used to perturb the vehicles from their uniform position, in meters (this is only used in case `spacing` is set to \"uniform\"). Defaults to 0 meters.\n",
    "- `bunching` (_float, optional_): reduce the portion of the network that should be filled with vehicles by this amount, in edge length. Defaults to 0. \n",
    "- `lanes_distribution` (_int, optional_): number of lanes the vehicles should be dispersed into. If the value is greater than the total number of lanes on an edge, vehicles are spread across all lanes. Defaults to infinity.\n",
    "- `edges_distribution` (_str / str list / (str -> int) dict, optional_): edges vehicles may be placed on. Can be either one of:\n",
    "    - \"all\": vehicles are distributed over all edges (default)\n",
    "    - list of edges vehicles can be distributed over\n",
    "    - dict where for each item, the key is the name of the edge and the value is the number of cars to place on that edge.\n",
    "- `additional_params` (_dict, optional_): some other network-specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Example using the Sugiyama experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lines of codes create a basic experiment in a ring, with 22 vehicles which initial position we can play with using `InitialConfig`. If you don't understand the following code, head over tutorial 1 which explains it.\n",
